        The PTS Masada is the airsoft gun release of the century. There is much controversy surrounding this gun with the the video game community and the common/uncommon features it has with the Bushmaster ACR. Nevertheless, Magpul PTS have worked tirelessly to produce this gun as accurately as possible to the real thing, and they have done just that. The hybrid metal and polymer construction have been done using only the finest materials and building process. The upper receiver is CNC machined from aluminum and the lower is made from Dupont reinforced polymer. The upper features a continuous top rail so the shooter can mount their choice of optics anywhere they want along the rail depending on their mission. The front sight is built into the upper receiver and is spring loaded so it can be deployed in less than a second; the top rail is also home to the rear MBUS flip sight, also spring loaded with an ambidextrous release lever. The controls on the gun like the magazine release, charging handle release and the fire selector are all ambidextrous. The QD sling swivel on the stock can be moved to the left or right side to accommodate any shooting hand. The fixed carbine stock is designed similar to the CTR stock in that it has a void in it to act like a handle, perfect for grabbing your gun on the go. The stock may not be adjustable for length but the built in cheek rest is adjustable for height to provide a comfortable cheek weld for different types of optics. One would need many types of optics on hand depending on their mission because the Masada has a quick change barrel system that allows it to be shortened or extended depending on the mission criteria. The barrel can be removed in a matter of seconds with no tools required. Magpul PTS did not just make an externally functional and aesthetically pleasing AEG, but they constructed the internals terrifically to match the awesome exterior. The Magpuls PTS Masada can be disassembled in a matter of minutes, down to the gearbox. The gearbox is a unique version 2 with a motor cage designed to keep the motor pinion gear in line with the bevel gear at all times. This gearbox also has a quick change spring function that will allow the user to change their muzzle velocity on the fly with minimal tools. The old school trigger contact assembly has been replaced with an electronic micro switch system to reduce arcing and prolong the life of the gun. The gears are kept in line with 8mm solid metal bushings; however the bevel gear has been given an 8mm ball bearing since it spins much faster relative to the other two gears. Magpul PTS have engineered the best airsoft gun the world has seen to this day. It's lightweight, performs well, and is built to last. The deconstruction of this gun is simple and requires little tools, a technician's utopia. The muzzle velocity can be changed in a matter of seconds, perfect for players that play in a variety of environments with different FPS limits. No other airsoft gun has the great features the Masada has that both enhance performance and are convenient for the owner.

    The difference in the guns is that a carbine is a medium to close range fighting because of it's average rounds per minute. A sub-machine gun is good a close range due to it's high rate of rounds per minute.
    The sniper is the best at long range due to it's very low rounds per minute.</aside>
