        Full metal except for the parts that aren't suppose to be. This is a really nice weapon. My chronod at 400 when shipped. Once zeroed this gun shoots very accurately thanks to the already installed tight bore barrel. I've had no wobble anywhere, but expect that the stock may loosen up with use. The dust cover doesn't like to stay closed, but that isn't that important to me. I used this last week in during my team skirmish and I was hitting people clear across the field and that's before I zeroed it. I would recommend using a large type battery since my mini 9.6v 2200 mah battery cause the gearbox to lock once it started to weaken. My mini lipo made it shoot better but drained quickly due to the type of gearbox and internals.</br>
    I got this gun off of Airsoft G.I. since they had it in stock and for $90 less :). This gun is amazing. Mine was chronoed at 403 FPS and is full metal. The upper and lower Reciever are made of Magnesium and so is the RIS giving it a diffrent feel then your normal Metal. The functional bolt catch is cool but you might grind down the bolt if you do it wrong. It comes with an Bi-Pod adapter so that saves you the money of buying one. It is only semi-auto so that means you can upgrade it to higher FPS for the fields. It comes with a QD Silencer which is made of metal too but has an ugly orange tip on it (I just scratched mine off and painted it black again) It also comes with a compact 50 round metal mag which is nice. The stock and pistol grip are not ABS plastic but rather a Nylon-Fiber which gives it a nicer feel. The 3 rail covers it came with are very comfortable once you get them on (i ended up sanding down the little notches to make them slide easier) One thing i wish they included was a rear flip up sight since it has a rear one. I ended up getting an AK SR-25 rear flip up sight for it. Over all i give this gun 5 Stars out of 5 because it is very good stock and is an amazing base gun for upgrading.</br>

    <aside>
    The difference in the guns is that a carbine is a medium to close range fighting because of it's average rounds per minute. A sub-machine gun is good a close range due to it's high rate of rounds per minute.
    The sniper is the best at long range due to it's very low rounds per minute.</aside>
